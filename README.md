# Game of Life JS

Implementation of the Game of Life in vanilla JS.

It shows a canvas with a clickable grid and a few controls to start, stop or reset THE GAME.

It also allows to load **PlainText patterns** from [LifeWiki](http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Main_Page).
The ```.cell``` files in the **Pattern Files** section of most of the pages in the wiki.
